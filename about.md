I am a software engineer living in Berlin. I currently work on Kotlin and Python, using them to solve real world logistics problems. In the past I worked with Javascript, C++ and CUDA to optimize video processing algorithms for television ad detection.

I grew up accross different cities in India, speaking about 4 different languages as a student. I spent 4 years at the [Computer Science and Engineering Department](https://www.nitt.edu/) at National Institute of Technology, Trichy, where I fell in love with programming.

I am big history geek and am fascinated by medival European and Central Asain history. I play chess quite often to take a break from work. In my free time I dabble with photography (like all millenials and Gen-Z) and sometimes write about my quite uneventful and boring life. I am also very passionate about test cricket and football. Big fan of Liverpool Football Club.
