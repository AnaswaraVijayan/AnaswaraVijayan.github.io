I am a data analyst living in Berlin. I currently work Python, SQL and Tableau, using them to solve real world machine learning problems. In the past I worked with Ernst & Young(E&Y) as a Tax Analyst. As a tax analyst, I gained valuable experience in analyzing finanacial data, identifying patterns and generating reports to support tax compliance and planning. This role enhanced my analytical skills and attention to detail. It enhanced my analytical skills as well as fostered my ability to work with strict deadlines. I recently tranistion to the field of data analytics seeking a new challenge. 

I completed an intensive program  at Ironhack, which provided me with a solid foundation in data manipulation, statistical analysis and machine learning. As part of the bootcamp, I successfully completed a project where I built a credit card approval model. This involved cleaning and preprocessing data, feature engineering, training machine learning models, and evaluating their performance. Through this project, I developed a deep understanding of data analytics methodologies and gained hands-on experience in utilizing Python libraries to solve real-world problems.
I also worked on a building a recommendation engine for recommending songs using Spotify's public API. The project involved scraping songs and clustering them using k-means clustering algorithm.

I enjoy travelling, soulful music and cooking. I have developed a recent interest in home decoration. I am a proud plant-mom.
